We now have documentation for [common questions](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet/blob/master/documentation/common_questions.md) and [common issues](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet/blob/master/documentation/common_problems_and_solutions.md). We now also provide [reference epoch times for several datasets and tips on how to identify bottlenecks](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet/blob/master/documentation/expected_epoch_times.md).

Please read these documents before posting issues!
