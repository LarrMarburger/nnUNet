# nnU-Netv2 benchmarks

Does your system run like it should? Is your epoch time longer than expected? What epoch times should you expect?

Look no further for we have the solution here!

## What does the nnU-netv2 benchmark do?

nnU-Net's benchmark trains models for 5 epochs and writes down the epoch times. At the end, the fastest epoch will 
be noted down, along with the GPU name, torch version and cudnn version. You can find the benchmark output in the 
corresponding nnUNet_results subfolder (see example below). Don't worry, we also provide scripts to collect your 
results. Or you just start a benchmark and look at the console output. Everything is fine.

The benchmark implementation revolves around two trainers:
- `nnUNetTrainerBenchmark_5epochs` runs a regular training for 5 epochs. When completed, writes a json file with the fastest 
epoch time as well as the gpu used and the torch and cudnn versions. Useful for speed testing the entire pipeline 
(data loading, augmentation, GPU training)
- `nnUNetTrainerBenchmark_5epochs_noDataLoading` is the same but it doesn't do any data loading or augmentation. It 
just presents dummy arrays to the GPU. Useful for checking pure GPU speed.

## How to run the nnU-Netv2 benchmark?
It's quite simple, actually. Looks just like a regular nnU-Net training.

We provide reference numbers for some of the medical segmentation decathlon datasets because they are easily 
accessible: [download here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HqEgzS8BV2c7xYNrZdEAnrHk7osJJ--2). If it needs to be 
quick and dirty, focus on Tasks 2 and 4. Download and extract the data and convert them to the nnU-Net format with 
`nnUNetv2_convert_MSD_dataset`. 
Run nnUNetv2_plan_and_preprocess for them.

Then, for each dataset, run the following commands (only one per GPU! Or one after the other):

```bash
nnUNetv2_train DATSET_ID 2d 0 -tr nnUNetTrainerBenchmark_5epochs
nnUNetv2_train DATSET_ID 3d_fullres 0 -tr nnUNetTrainerBenchmark_5epochs
nnUNetv2_train DATSET_ID 2d 0 -tr nnUNetTrainerBenchmark_5epochs_noDataLoading
nnUNetv2_train DATSET_ID 3d_fullres 0 -tr nnUNetTrainerBenchmark_5epochs_noDataLoading
```

If you want to inspect the outcome manually, check your 
`nnUNet_results/DATASET_NAME/nnUNetTrainerBenchmark_5epochs__nnUNetPlans__3d_fullres/fold_0/` folder for the `benchmark_result.json` file.

Note that there can be multiple entries in this file if the benchmark was run on different GPU types, torch versions or cudnn versions!

If you want to summarize your results like we did in our [results](#results), check the 
[summary script](../nnunetv2/batch_running/benchmarking/summarize_benchmark_results.py). Here you need to change the 
torch version, cudnn version and dataset you want to summarize, then execute the script. You can find the exact 
values you need to put there in one of your `benchmark_result.json` files.

## Results
We have tested a variety of GPUs and summarized the results in a 
[spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Cvt_gr8XU2qWaE0XJk5jJlxMEESPxyqW0CWbQhTNNY/edit?usp=sharing). 
Note that you can select the torch and cudnn versions at the bottom! We recommend you always pick the most recent one.

## Result interpretation

Results are shown as epoch time in seconds. Lower is better (duh). Epoch times can fluctuate between runs, so as 
long as you are within like 5-10% of the numbers we report everything should be dandy. 

If not, here is how you can try to find the culprit!

The first thing to do is to compare the performance between the `nnUNetTrainerBenchmark_5epochs_noDataLoading` and 
`nnUNetTrainerBenchmark_5epochs` trainers. If the difference is about the same as we report here, but both your numbers 
are worse, the problem is with your GPU:

- are you certain you compare the correct gpu? (duh)
- If yes, then you might want to install pytorch in a different way. Never `pip install torch`! Go to the
[PyTorch installation](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) page, select the most recent cuda version your 
system supports and only then copy end execute the correct command! Either pip or conda should work
- If the problem is still not fixed, we recommend you try 
[compiling pytorch from source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#from-source). It's more difficult but that's 
how we roll here at the DKFZ (at least the cool kids here).
- Finally, some very basic things that could impact your GPU performance: 
  - is the GPU cooled adequately? Check temperature with `nvidia-smi`. Hot GPUs throttle performance in order to not self destruct
  - is your OS using the GPU for displaying stuff? If so then you can expect a performance penalty (I dunno like 10% !?)
  - Are others using the GPU as well?


If you see a large performance difference between `nnUNetTrainerBenchmark_5epochs_noDataLoading` (fast) and 
`nnUNetTrainerBenchmark_5epochs` (slow) then the problem might be related to data loading and augmentation. As a 
reminder, nnU-net does not use pre-augmented images (offline augmentation) but instead generates augmented training 
samples on the fly during training (no you cannot switch it to offline). This requires that your system can read the 
images fast enough (SSD storage required!) and that your CPU is powerful enough to run the augmentations.

Check the following:

- [CPU bottleneck] How many CPU threads are running during the training? nnU-Net uses 12 processes for data augmentation by default. 
If those 12 are running, consider increasing the number of processes used for data augmentation (provided there is 
headroom on your CPU!). You can do so by exporting the `nnUNet_n_proc_DA` environment variable:
  `export nnUNet_n_proc_DA=XX` followed by the training OR `nnUNet_n_proc_DA=XX nnUNetv2_train [...]`. If you want to 
make this permanent, add the environment variable to your .bashrc. How do so this for windows? Well I dunno so google 
might help. If your CPU does not support more processes (setting more processes than your CPU has threads makes 
no sense!) you are out of luck and in desperate need of a system upgrade!
- [I/O bottleneck] If you don't see 12 (or nnUNet_n_proc_DA if you set this) processes running then open up `top` 
(sorry, Windows users) and look at the value left of 'wa' in the row that begins with '%Cpu (s)'. If this is >1 then 
your storage cannot keep up with data loading. Make sure to set nnUNet_preprocessed to a folder that is located on an 
SSD. nvme is preferred over SATA. PCIe3 is enough. 3000MB/s sequential read recommended.
- [funky stuff] sometimes there is funky stuff going on, especially when batch sizes are large, files are small and 
patch sizes are smal as well. As part of the data loading process, nnU-Net needs to open and close a file for each 
training sample. Now imagine a dataset like Dataset004_Hippocampus where for the 2d config we have a batch size of 
366 and we run 250 iterations in 10s on an A100. That's a lotta files per second. Oof. If the files are on some 
network drive (even if it's nvme) then good night. The good news: nnU-Net has got you covered: add 
`export nnUNet_keep_files_open=True` to your .bashrc and the problem goes away. The neat part: it causes new problems 
if you are not allowed to have enough open files. You may have to increase the number of allowed open files. `ulimit -n` 
gives your current limit (sorry Windows folks!). It should not be 1024. 65535 works for me. See here how to change 
these limits: [Link](https://kupczynski.info/posts/ubuntu-18-10-ulimits/) (works for Ubuntu 18, google for your Linux version!).
